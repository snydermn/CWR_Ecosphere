"https://github.com/snydermn/migration_corridor_simulation_model/columbia_application" contains the R code used to combine replicates and summarize output from HexSim migration corridor simulation model parameterized for Columbia River from Bonneville Dam to Snake River confluence. 

Date is generated by an individual based model created in the HexSim model application. 
The parameterized model used to generate results for each experiment will be stored at the US EPA's Environmental Dataset Gateway.


Files in the "01_combine_replicates" folder are used to combine replicate model runs from the numerous simulated experiments:
01_combine_replicates/grande_ronde_sthd_combine_replicates3.rmd
01_combine_replicates/grande_ronde_sthd_combine_replicates9.rmd
01_combine_replicates/grande_ronde_sthd_combine_replicates10.rmd
01_combine_replicates/grande_ronde_sthd_combine_replicates11.rmd
01_combine_replicates/grande_ronde_sthd_combine_replicates12.rmd
01_combine_replicates/snake_chnk_combine_replicates3.rmd

Files in "02_summarize_model_outputs" are used to summarize model outcomes from the combined and replicated model runs:

Summary of each file-
02_summarize_model_outputs/arrival_timing_histograms.rmd - For both populations and for all scenarios creates arrival timing histograms.

02_summarize_model_outputs/gr_snake_dd_rCDF_plots.rmd - For both populations and for all scenarios creates reverse cumulative distribution function for accumulated degree days above 20, 21, and 22 degree celsius.

02_summarize_model_outputs/GR_SR_2D_HDR_plots.rmd - For both populations and for all scenarios creates bivariate highly dimensional region boxplot produced with entry timing and total travel time in the migration corridor outside of coldwater refuges.

02_summarize_model_outputs/GR_SR_2017_energy_used_stats.rmd - For both populations and for all scenarios calculates energy remaining quantiles.
